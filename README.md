# design-match

This is a CSS matching exercise for Mass Mutual. It uses Sass and Bootstrap to approximate a layout for both a mobile and desktop version of a simple page.

I'm a little out of my wheelhouse writing CSS and Sass from scratch. I've done some troubleshooting of each, but this isn't my strong point.

And I've run into a blockade where for whatever reason, none of my edits are having any effect anymore... so I'm just going to submit what I have. 

The mm-theme/_code-exercise.css file is included in mm-code-exercise.scss, which in turn is compiled by Sass into mm-code-exercise.css, which is used by the code-exercise.html page.
